                    <p>Good coffee is flavoursome and aromatic with a balance of sweetness and acidity. The flavour and
                        aroma
                        range from chocolate and nut to fruity and floral. Good coffee has a natural sweetness that is
                        complemented by a refreshing acidity. Bitterness is always present in coffee, but it never
                        dominates the
                        cup</p>

                <h2>Arabica Coffee Beans (Coffea arabica)</h2>

                <p>Arabica beans are by far the most popular type of coffee beans, making up about 60% of the world’s
                    coffee. These tasty beans originated many centuries ago in the highlands of Ethiopia, and may even
                    be the first coffee beans ever consumed! The name Arabica likely comes from the beans’ popularity in
                    7th-century Arabia </p>

            <div class="col ">
                <h2>Robusta Coffee Beans (Coffea caniphora)</h2>

                <p>The second most popular type of coffee bean is Robusta. This bean originated in sub-Saharan Africa
                    and is now grown primarily in Africa and Indonesia. It’s also particularly popular in Vietnam and is
                    often mixed into coffee blends. It’s a less expensive variety, making it a very budget-friendly
                    choice for roasters.</p>

                <p>A typical cappuccino is one-third espresso, one-third hot milk, and one-third milk foam. You can also
                    order a dry cappuccino, which will be made with less milk.</p>
